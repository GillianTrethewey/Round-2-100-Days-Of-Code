R2D40 Round 2 Day 26-40 October 22, 2020

**Progress**: SASS Udemy

**What is going on**: Switched to SASS so I can work better with my developer mentor. Will be back to JavaScript afterwards. Building a dummy website with SASS and Flexbox according to the Udemy course.

Also rebuilt my business website with the Sample Theme from Genesis and used CSS Grid to populate the product grids. 

**Thoughts**: Thinking about DRY in CSS vs DRY in SASS - cleaning up the SASS files seems to clutter the CSS files.
